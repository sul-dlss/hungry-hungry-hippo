# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

            We highly recommend every deposit be assigned a license when possible. A license helps others who access the
            content to understand what the Depositor is allowing them to do with the work and under what conditions.
          tooltip_html: >-
            As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) a specific license  you choose from the list will be mandatory for every deposit to the collection ("Require license for all deposits") or 2) if the Depositors will be able to choose the license they wish to use ("Depositor selects license").  For this second option, you must choose a license from the list to be displayed as the default option for Depositors, which they will be able to change.

With this option, you can choose to display to the depositor the default instructions we have written, or write your own instructions.

            A Reviewer checks a deposit for clarity, accuracy, and completeness before approving the publication.
            Only one Reviewer is required to review each deposit. A Reviewer can edit a deposit or return it to the
            Depositor with a request for changes. The Depositor will receive a notification when their deposit is returned or approved.
