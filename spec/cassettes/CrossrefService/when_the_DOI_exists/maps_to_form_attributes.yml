        difficult-to-understand clinical features characterize COVID-19 and post-acute
        sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or long COVID [LC]). These can include blood pressure
        instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and neuropsychiatric complaints.
        The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
        receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
        on the surface of host cells to initiate infection. We hypothesized that some
        people convalescing from COVID-19 may produce anti-RBD antibodies that resemble
        ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity, that is, they are
        ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19
        and LC. In previous work, we showed that some people with acute COVID-19 had
        immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic activity, suggesting that
        some people with COVID-19 indeed produced ACE2-like abzymes. However, it remained
        unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only in acute COVID-19 or whether
        ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in people convalescing from COVID-19.
        Here, we show that some people convalescing from COVID-19 attending a clinic
        for people with persistent pulmonary symptoms also have ACE2-like abzymes
        and that the presence of ACE2-like catalytic activity correlates with alterations
        in blood pressure in an exercise test.<\/jats:p>\n                  <\/jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                    <jats:title>IMPORTANCE<\/jats:title>\n                    <jats:p>Patients
        who have had COVID-19 can sometimes have troublesome symptoms, termed post-acute
        sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID (LC), which can include problems
        with blood pressure regulation, gastrointestinal problems, inflammation, blood
        clotting, and symptoms like \u201cbrain fog.\u201d The proximate causes for
        these problems are not known, which makes these problems difficult to treat
        definitively. We previously found that some acute COVID-19 patients make antibodies
        against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that act like an enzyme,
        angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 normally helps regulate blood
        pressure and serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the body. We show that
        patients convalescing from COVID-19 also make antibodies that act like ACE2
        and that the presence of those antibodies correlates with problems in blood
        pressure regulation. The findings provide a new opening to potentially understanding
        the causes of LC, and so provide direction for the development of new treatments.<\/jats:p>\n                  <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1128\/mbio.01735-25","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,22]],"date-time":"2025-07-22T13:00:09Z","timestamp":1753189209000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1128\/asmj-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["ACE-2-like
