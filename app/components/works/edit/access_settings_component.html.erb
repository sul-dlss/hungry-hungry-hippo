<p>
  You can prevent individual files from being displayed on the PURL page,
  meaning viewers of the page can neither see or download the files. All files
  are still preserved in the SDR, whether they are visible or not. If a file was
  available to viewers on a previous version of this work, it will continue to
  be available on the pages for the older versions.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent displaying a specific file, return to the "Manage files" page and select "Hide" to the right of the file name.
